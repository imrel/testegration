### Integration tests made easy

How much code do you need to have your db ready for first test?

----
Postgres.docker("my-project", "9.6.1").run();
----

That's it. No maven or gradle custom scripting, no plugins, everything works from an IDE.

And how much code do you need to revert all the commits before the second tests?
----
Postgres.docker("my-project", "9.6.1").run();
----

And how long will it take?

And what if there wasn't any db running?
One would be started automatically before the first test
so you would have to wait ~5s longer.
